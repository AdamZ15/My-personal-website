<h1 style="color: white; font-family:Comic Sans MS; text-align: center;">My Education</h1>

<h2 style="color: white; font-family:Comic Sans MS; text-align: center;">Primary School</h3>

<img src="images/SKTT2.jfif" class="center" style="width: 500px">

<p style="color: white; text-align: justify;">This is my first school (well I do go to kindegarden for two years but let just start with the formal one). This s Sekolah Kebangsaan Taman Tasik Ampang, Selangor or SKTT for short. Quick info and history, this school was located in Jalan Tasek Tambahan 2, Ampang Selangor was built towards the end of 1983 and was finished in 1984. The school covers 5.5 acres and is made up of two one-story prefabricated building blocks. Originally, this structure had an office, a library, eleven classrooms, and two teachers' restrooms, but it lacked essential amenities such as electricity, running water, and a canteen. However, year by year, SKTT become one of the most competent school for the Hulu Langat district. My pops registered me to this school in 2009 and I have my education here for six years. From standard one until three, I enter class Cekal, on Standard four till six, I entered Fikir. I got 4B 1C for my UPSR (Ujian Penilaian Sekolah Rendah).</p>

<h2 style="color: white; font-family:Comic Sans MS; text-align: center;">Primary School (Religious School)</h2>

<img src="images/SRATT.webp" class="center" style="width: 500px">

<p style="color: white; text-align: justify;">At the evening (morning for standard one and three), I will go to seek education for hereafter as a Muslim. subject like Sirah that teach history of the Prophet Peace Be Upon Him (PBUH) (Also little known fact the classes here are name after the four Sahaba of the Prophet who later establish a caliphate named Rashidun Caliphate and one of Prophet uncle. Those are Abu Bakar, Umar, Uthman, Ali and Prophet's uncle, Hamzah), Fiqh knowledge and Jawi writing and knowledge, a writing and language that almost extinct because it got betrayed and killed by it's own race. Welcome to Sekolah Rendah Agama (SRA) Tasek Tambahan, 68000 Ampang, Selangor. Like SKTT I also seek education here for six years. In Year Six, I got Jayyid Jidan in PSRA a.k.a Penilaian Sekolah Rendah Agama (well it kinda like all your subject are total and you got B for the UPSR of Religious School).</p>

<h2 style="color: white; font-family:Comic Sans MS; text-align: center;">Secondary School</h2>

<img src="images/SMKTT.jfif" class="center" style="width: 500px">

<p style="color: white; text-align: justify;">I spend my teenage years in secondary school located next to my primary school. The school was given name Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Taman Tasik or SMKTT or if you want to remember your causelor named the school, it was Lake Garden High School (Name is cool, ngl). For PT3 (Pentaksiran Tingkatan 3) I broke my mother heart's for getting an F for Math and for Form four and five, I try my best for SPM (Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia). Got 4As (2As, 2A-s), 3Bs (2 are B+ while for Math, a B) and an approving C. Ma was shock and cried with tears of joy for my result. With this result, I can proceed to continue my study to a higher education.</p>

<img src="images/UiTMMachang.jfif" class="center" style="width: 500px">

<p style="color: white; text-align: justify;">After SPM, got my car license successfully, and work as a cashier at my grandaunt restaurant, I got an offer to study at UiTM Machang, university on a land as low as a flower garden in Diploma of Information Management (would later become Information Science and Multimedia)  I should enter the U in October of 2020 but since Covid-19 struck and lockdown occurred all over the world we will study online for four semesters (actually for me is three since I need to take my MUET exam in order to continue study for degree (the result is good btw)). So this is the final sem of Diploma so I will update later. See you for Degree.</p>
